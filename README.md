# Discord Server API
I have been trying to find how to request discord api to get eg. discord server member count with just server id or server invite.
Heres the api request to get even more info:
                                          - Server name
                                          - Guild id
                                          - Server banner
                                          - Server description
                                          - Vanity code
                                          - Is NSFW ?
                                          - Announcement channel ID
                                          - _Online member count_
                                          - _Total member count_
> To make your code work make sure to don't send any data in the request.
